## API Usage
While this API is free to use, you still need to buy the plugin to be able to use it. The plugin can be purchased [here](https://builtbybit.com/resources/player-geolocation.39748/) *(not public yet)*

### Preparation
Make sure you depend on this API in your `plugin.yml`.
> File: plugin.yml
>```yaml
>name: YourPlugin
>main: path.to.your.MainClass
>...
>depend:
>   - GeoUtil
>...
>```

### Adding a geo-blocked region
This is how you tell the API to block players from countries by providing the country code of that country:

```java
import net.mplugins.geoutil.api.GeoUtilApi;

import java.util.Locale;

@Override
public void onEnable() {
    // This is how to block players from Germany
    GeoUtilApi.getPermissionHandler().denyJoin(Locale.GERMANY.getCountry());

    // This is how to block players from USA
    GeoUtilApi.getPermissionHandler().denyJoin(Locale.US.getCountry());
}
```
